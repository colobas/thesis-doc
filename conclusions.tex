\section{Future Work}
\label{section:future}

After the work presented here, several future research questions and ideas
arise:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Better initialization strategies. Could we pre-train the variational
    posterior so as to promote earlier convergence?
    \item Additional loss terms / regularization: could there be an approach
    to incentivize the variational posterior to correctly assign regions
    of the space to individual components? For instance, \autocite{semisuplearning_nflows}
    use a regularization strategy based on a consistency loss term.
    \item ...
\end{itemize}
