I would like to thank my family for providing me with everything I needed to
arrive here. To my wife, for her unconditional love and support, which allowed me
to focus on finishing this important chapter of my life. To my technically savvy
friends: thank you for the fruitful insights and discussions. To my friends
from Técnico: thank you for being the best partners I could hope for in this journey
we went through together - \emph{la Varanda}! To all my friends: thank you for
your friendship, which gave me the emotional stability I needed in this wild
period of my life. To my former employers and friends at Jungle, thank you
for having created opportunities for me to accomplish this while at Jungle, and
for still making me feel like you had my back even after I decided to leave.

A full paragraph is warranted to thank my advisor, Prof. Mário Figueiredo.
It was truly an honor (and also a great responsability) to have had the chance
to be advised by someone I already admired as an expert, but now also admire as
an individual. Thank you for always having listened and taken my ideas into consideration,
even with all the pivots and twists this work took, since its beginning. Thank you for
your patience and guidance, and for all the conversations we had, technical and
non-technical ones. If I ever become a Professor, I hope I can be half the one
you are.
